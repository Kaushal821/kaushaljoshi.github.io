        <h3>Entanglement Studies in the AKLT Spin-1 Biquadratic Model</h3>
        <p>
            This thesis presents a numerical investigation of quantum entanglement
            in the Affleck–Kennedy–Lieb–Tasaki (AKLT) spin-1 biquadratic model.
            Entanglement measures such as Wootters’ concurrence and von Neumann
            entropy were used to analyze bipartite correlations. The ground-state
            properties were verified to be singlet in nature, and signatures of
            quantum phase transitions were explored using optimized numerical
            techniques and parallel computation.

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Quantum Entanglement in Multi-Qubit Systems</h3>
        <p>
            Summer Research Fellowship project at IIT Dharwad focused on detecting
            quantum entanglement in multi-qubit systems using the covariance
            matrix criterion. The work involved extending the criterion to
            higher-dimensional systems and understanding its limitations in
            quantifying entanglement.

        <h3>Radio Astronomy and RGBC Image Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Research work under the RAD@Home program involving the analysis of
            extragalactic radio sources through RGBC image construction.
            Multi-wavelength FITS data were analyzed to study morphological
            features and identify unusual radio galaxy structures.

        <h3>Positional Astronomy at Jantar Mantar</h3>
        <p>
            Observational project centered on historical astronomical instruments
            at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi. The work included calculating the Sun’s
            altitude and azimuth, determining local time for multiple locations,
            and understanding the working principles of traditional Indian
            astronomical instruments.
